# README: BART Bayesian Model Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) using a Bayesian modeling approach. It aims to analyze and simulate the expected value of points and decision-making processes within the task under specified conditions and beliefs.

## Key Concepts
- **BART**: A psychological task to measure risk-taking behavior.
- **Bayesian Modeling**: Using the Bayesian approach to model the probability distribution of the balloon popping.
- **Simulation**: Simulating the BART under various strategies and calculating the expected total score.

## Prerequisites
- Python Libraries: `numpy`, `scipy.stats`
- Basic understanding of Bayesian statistics, probability distributions, and Python programming.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook/Lab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to observe the modeling, simulation, and analyses.

## Note
Feel free to explore different parameters, priors, and strategies within the notebook.
